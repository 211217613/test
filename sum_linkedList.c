/*
Reference Parameters In C
We are bumping into a basic "feature" of the C language that changes to local parameters
are never reflected back in the caller's memory. This is a traditional tricky area of C
programming. We will present the traditional "reference parameter" solution to this
problem, but you may want to consult another C resource for further information. (See
Pointers and Memory (http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/) for a detailed explanation of
reference parameters in C and C++.)
We need Push() to be able to change some of the caller's memory â€” namely the head
variable. The traditional method to allow a function to change its caller's memory is to
pass a pointer to the caller's memory instead of a copy. So in C, to change an 
int in the caller, pass a int*  instead. To change a struct fraction
, pass a struct fraction*  intead. To change an X , pass an X* . So in this case, the value we want to
change is struct node* , so we pass a struct node**
 instead. The two stars (**) are a little scary, but really it's just a straight application of the rule. It just happens
that the value we want to change already has one star (*), so the parameter to change it
has two (**). Or put another way: the type of the head pointer is "pointer to a struct
node." In order to change that pointer, we need to pass a pointer to it, which will be a
"pointer to a pointer to a struct node". Instead of defining WrongPush(struct node* head, int data);
 we define Push(struct node** headRef, int data);
. The first form passes a copy of the head pointer. The second, correct form passes a pointer to the head pointer. The rule
is: to modify caller memory, pass a pointer to that memory. The parameter has the word
"ref" in it as a reminder that this is a "reference" (
struct node**) pointer to the head pointer instead of an ordinary (
struct node*) copy of the head pointer.
